# ScanOcean project - Revamp in progress
First year project at CentraleSupélec, Paris-Saclay Graduate School of Engineering, revamped and cleaned up in 2022 by Louis de Oliveira and Théo Saulus.

The ScanOcean team proposes to complete the work of the previous year by considering a swarm of autonomous underwater drones. Our objective is to propose an original and efficient method of space exploration that will make it possible to secure an area, typically in a mine warfare context.
